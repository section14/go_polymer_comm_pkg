package controller

/*

Figure out a way to implement this interface. A regular user interface will probably be handy too.
Probably need to somehow pass the http request in here so it can parse the JWT token, and validate the user.

Also, it may make more sense to bring the JWT methods into this file (or their own file) since it's going
to be needed throughout this package, and should be de-coupled from the main backend file.
